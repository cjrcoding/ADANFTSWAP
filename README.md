## 🧶 RUGSWAP.IO

### 🤝 What is RUGSWAP?

RUGSWAP.IO is a decentralized swap platform that lets users trade verified Cardano NFTs directly — no tokens, no liquidity pools, just pure collectible-for-collectible swaps.  
Our mission is to make trading fun, transparent, and a little bit weird again.

Unlike tumbler protocols or pseudo-marketplaces, RUGSWAP focuses on **community-first swapping** with two primary modes:
- **Transparent Swaps** – You see what you're getting before you trade
- **Surprise Swaps (coming soon)** – Embrace chaos and mystery by opting into randomized pool trades

### 🎨 Why "RUG"?

Because we're reclaiming the rug.  
Our mascot, **Rugus**, is a happy, self-aware rug who lives to be traded.  
He knows the game. He *is* the game.  
And yes — achievement NFTs like “Diamond Rugger” and “Floor Lord” are part of the roadmap.

### 🔒 Core Values
- **Security-First**: Users choose their swaps. No custodial hold. No sketchy scripts.
- **Verified Collections Only**: Limit risk and protect collectors.
- **Art Over DeFi**: Focused on fun, collectibility, and engagement — not yield farming.
- **Composable**: Built to expand — on-chain achievements, evolving NFTs, and artist-led pools are all on deck.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Aiken (Cardano-native)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (with Tailwind styling)
- **Backend**: Rust & Lucid integration (planned)
- **Deployment**: Demeter + GitHub Actions
